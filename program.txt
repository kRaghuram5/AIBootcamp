Experiment with depth (number of layers)

model 1:
Build a model with SDG optimizer, Train it 
Find the validation accuracy(128)

model 2:
Build a model with adam optimizer,train it
and find the validation accuracy

model 3:
Build a model with 5 RMSProp optimizer and 
find the validation accuracy

plot validation accuracy for all three models in single plot. 

plot the loss for all three models

NOTE use differet model name for each of the model.
